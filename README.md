# github.com/tail-call

This is my personal GitHub. A lot of code that I write for myself eventually gets uploaded here. Most of the repos are only interesting for me, but I try to document things at least somewhat. Feel free to reach out (and touch faith) if you're interested in anything.

Check out my [gists](https://gist.github.com/tail-call), I post funny stuff there. It's sorta like Twitter for me.
